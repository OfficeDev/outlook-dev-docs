# Outlook API reference documentation

The Outlook REST APIs are a part of [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview). Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Graph to access Outlook mail, calendar, and contacts. You should use the Outlook API endpoints directly (via `https://outlook.office.com/api`) only if you require a feature that is not available on the Graph endpoints.

For more information about the differences between Graph and the Outlook endpoints, see [Compare Microsoft Graph and Outlook endpoints](compare-graph.md).
