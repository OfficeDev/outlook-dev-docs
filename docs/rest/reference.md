# Outlook API reference

The Outlook REST APIs are a part of [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/). Microsoft recommends using Microsoft Graph to access Outlook mail, calendar, and contacts. You should use the Outlook API endpoints directly (via `https://outlook.office.com/api`) only if you require a feature that is not available on the Graph endpoints. 

For more information about the differences between Graph and the Outlook endpoints, see [Compare Microsoft Graph and Outlook endpoints](compare-graph-outlook.md).
