# Send an actionable message via email in Office 365

## Supported scenarios

Sending actionable messages via email is supported in the following scenarios.

- The recipient must be an individual, not a group.
- The recipient must be visible on the message. Do not put the recipient in the BCC field.
- The recipient must have a mailbox on Outlook.com or Exchange Online in Office 365.

## Create an actionable message card

Let's start by creating an actionable message card. We'll start with something simple, just a basic card with an `Action.Http` action and an `Action.OpenUrl` action. We'll use the [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/) to design the card.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sample card markup in this topic omits the `originator` property. This works in a testing scenario, where the recipient is the same as the sender. When sending actionable messages to anyone else, the `originator` property must be set to a valid provider ID generated by the [Actionable Email Developer Dashboard](actionable-email-dev-dashboard.md). Leaving this property empty when sending to others results in the card being removed.

Go to the Card Playground and paste in the following JSON:

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.0",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "Visit the Outlook Dev Portal",
      "size": "large"
    },
    {
        "type": "TextBlock",
        "text": "Click **Learn More** to learn more about Actionable Messages!"
    },
    {
      "type": "Input.Text",
      "id": "feedbackText",
      "placeholder": "Let us know what you think about Actionable Messages"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Action.Http",
      "title": "Send Feedback",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://...",
      "body": "{{feedbackText.value}}"
    },
    {
      "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
      "title": "Learn More",
      "url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages"
    }
  ]
}
```

Feel free to experiment with this simple example in the playground. You can see the [adaptive card reference](adaptive-card.md) for details on the available fields. Once you have a card you're happy with, you can move on to sending it.

## Sending actionable messages via email

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can design and test actionable messages by using the [Card Playground](https://messagecardplayground.azurewebsites.net/), which allows you to send actionable messages to yourself. You can also send actionable messages to yourself using the [Office 365 SMTP server](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/POP-and-IMAP-settings-for-Outlook-Office-365-for-business-7fc677eb-2491-4cbc-8153-8e7113525f6c). You will be unable to send actionable messages to any other user until you have registered using the [actionable messages developer dashboard](https://aka.ms/publishoam).

To embed an actionable message card in an email message, we need to wrap the card in a `<script>` tag. The `<script>` tag is then inserted into the `<head>` of the email's HTML body.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the card JSON must be wrapped in a `<script>` tag, the body of the actionable message email MUST be HTML. Plain-text messages are not supported.

1. Add the `hideOriginalBody` attribute to control what happens with the body of the email. In this case we'll set the attribute to `true` so that the body will not be shown.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.0",
      "hideOriginalBody": true,
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Visit the Outlook Dev Portal",
          "size": "large"
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Click **Learn More** to learn more about Actionable Messages!"
        },
        {
          "type": "Input.Text",
          "id": "feedbackText",
          "placeholder": "Let us know what you think about Actionable Messages"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "Action.Http",
          "title": "Send Feedback",
          "method": "POST",
          "url": "https://...",
          "body": "{{feedbackText.value}}"
        },
        {
          "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
          "title": "Learn More",
          "url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Wrap the resulting JSON in a `<script>` tag of type `application/adaptivecard+json`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using the [legacy message card format](message-card-reference.md) rather than the Adaptive card format, the `<script>` tag type MUST be `application/ld+json`.

    ```html
    <script type="application/adaptivecard+json">{
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.0",
      "hideOriginalBody": true,
      "body": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Visit the Outlook Dev Portal",
          "size": "large"
        },
        {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Click **Learn More** to learn more about Actionable Messages!"
        },
        {
          "type": "Input.Text",
          "id": "feedbackText",
          "placeholder": "Let us know what you think about Actionable Messages"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "Action.Http",
          "title": "Send Feedback",
          "method": "POST",
          "url": "https://...",
          "body": "{{feedbackText.value}}"
        },
        {
          "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
          "title": "Learn More",
          "url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages"
        }
      ]
    }
    </script>
    ```

1. Generate an HTML document to represent the email body and include the `<script>` tag in the `<head>`.

    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <script type="application/adaptivecard+json">{
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.0",
        "hideOriginalBody": true,
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Visit the Outlook Dev Portal",
            "size": "large"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Click **Learn More** to learn more about Actionable Messages!"
          },
          {
            "type": "Input.Text",
            "id": "feedbackText",
            "placeholder": "Let us know what you think about Actionable Messages"
          }
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "Action.Http",
            "title": "Send Feedback",
            "method": "POST",
            "url": "https://...",
            "body": "{{feedbackText.value}}"
          },
          {
            "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
            "title": "Learn More",
            "url": "https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages"
          }
        ]
      }
      </script>
    </head>
    <body>
    Visit the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/actionable-messages">Outlook Dev Portal</a> to learn more about Actionable Messages.
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Send a message via SMTP with the HTML as the body.

### Sending the message

For examples of sending messages, see the following.

- [Send Actionable Message via Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/jasonjoh/send-actionable-message): A sample console app written in C# that sends an actionable message using [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph).
- [Send Actionable Message via SMTP](https://github.com/tony-zhu/SendActionableMessage): A sample Python script that sends an actionable message using the Office 365 SMTP server. It also includes a sample HTML payload for the actionable message email body.

### Perform actions

For examples of performing actions, see the following.

- [Hello Actionable Messages](https://github.com/OfficeDev/HelloActionableMessages): A sample project with one-click button Azure deployment. This sample is a simple end-to-end actionable message solution that can be up and working within 10 minutes, and serves as a reference for building a production action endpoint.

## Troubleshooting tools

- [Actionable Messages Debugger](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381686): an Outlook add-in that allows developers to inspect the card payload in their actionable messages and identify why the card is not rendering.
