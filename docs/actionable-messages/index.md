# Actionable messages in Outlook and Office 365 Groups

[!INCLUDE [global-onboarding-paused-notice](../includes/actionable-messages/global-onboarding-paused-notice.md)]

Whether you are filling out a survey, approving an expense report, or updating a CRM sales opportunity, Actionable Messages enable you to take quick actions right from within Outlook. Developers can now embed actions in their emails or notifications, elevating user engagement with their services and increasing organizational productivity.

## User experience

Let's take a look at the end-to-end user experience.

### Group membership request approval scenario

A Contoso employee submits a request to join a private Office 365 group. Office 365 sends an Actionable Message to the person who owns the group to approve or decline the request. The card included in the message contains all the information the approver might need to quickly understand who submitted the request and any message they included to explain their request. It also includes **Approve** and **Decline** actions that can be taken right from Outlook. The owner approves the request, and the card updates to indicate the outcome.

The new member of the group submits a second request to add her team members to the group. Office 365 sends an Actionable Message to the owner with clear information about who submitted the request and the new members to add. The recipient can approve all, some, or none of the proposed new members. The owner approves one new member, and the card updates to indicate the outcome. The approved member is no longer selectable, while the remaining member remains selectable.

The owner declines the other requested new member, and the card updates to indicate the outcome. Both members are no longer selectable, and the action buttons are removed.

## Outlook version requirements for actionable messages

Actionable messages are available to all customer mailboxes on Exchange Online in Office 365 or Outlook.com with a supported client. The following table lists the availability of actionable messages for current Outlook clients. For information on the Office 365 release channels, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 apps](/deployoffice/updates/overview-update-channels). For current supported versions of Microsoft 365 Apps, see [supported versions](/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date#supported-versions).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently actionable message cards do not change the way that they render when Outlook is in dark mode. Support for dark mode for actionable messages is coming soon. Actionable messages are not supported when you use Outlook on the web in a browser on a mobile device.
